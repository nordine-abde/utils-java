# utils-java
This repository contains a collection of Java code that I originally wrote for personal use, mainly to keep them in one place and not lose track of them.

If anyone finds them useful and wants to use them, feel free to do so â€” just make sure you understand what the code does and use it at your own risk.

Some of the code is designed to very specific purposes, so you may need to modify it to fit your needs.

Some of the code may be outdated or out of the original context, so it may not work as expected.
